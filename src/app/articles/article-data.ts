With the introduction of Xcode 7, developers can use the powerful Markdown syntax to apply rich text formatting to the text of their documentation, which in combination to specific keywords that indicate special parts (like parameters, function results, etc) can result to an amazing outcome. The new Markdown-enabled documentation style, as the new one has several advantages: It provides greater level for customizing the text, it&#8217;s more flexible, and of course, more interesting.

Since it was tuned specifically for Java, it had some high-level operations to streamline tasks like generating proxy classes for calling web services based on a supplied WSDL file.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, speaking of code generation, <strong>Carrie</strong> sends us this code block. It&#8217;s a Perl script that&#8217;s called from an Ant build. It runs after generating a class based off a WSDL. It parses Java code using Regular Expressions and injects a <code>ListWrapper</code> class which ...</p>",
